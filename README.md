**Anvesh** (Sanskrit for *Investigation/Research*) is a modern, high-performance lead generation engine made with ❤️ in **Bharat**. It acts as a virtual research assistant that dives into the "Blue Ocean" of profitable businesses (Roofers, Dentists, Manufacturers) that have high revenue but **no website**. These leads are invisible to standard search tools but are high-value targets for agencies and freelancers.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🧠 Smart De-duplication:** Detects and ignores duplicate listings and recurring results using PostgreSQL constraints.
*   **📊 Deep Verification:** Extracts **Category, Ratings, Review Count, and Claimed Status**.
*   **🛡️ Thread-Safe Execution:** Optimized for stability on both Windows and Linux environments.
*   **🐳 Docker Ready:** Full stack setup (FastAPI + PostgreSQL) with a single command.
